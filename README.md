# ogs-samples
OGS sample projects - showcases ranging from small "how-to" snippes to full-blown projects showing the features of OGS

## Samples Documentation

The samples documentation is written in Markdown text. To better read these (*.md)
files, either see them online (at [https://github.com/haller-erne/ogs-samples](https://github.com/haller-erne/ogs-samples)) or use a decent text editor with Markdown support (e.g. the free [Visual Studio Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)).

## OGS Documentation

For more documentation about OGS in general, see the main [OGS Documentation site](https://haller-erne.github.io/ogs/).
