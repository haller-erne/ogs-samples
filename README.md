# ogs-samples
OGS sample projects - showcases ranging from small "how-to" snippets to full-blown projects showing the features of OGS

## Samples Documentation

The samples documentation is written in Markdown text. To better read these (*.md)
files, either see them online (at [https://github.com/haller-erne/ogs-samples](https://github.com/haller-erne/ogs-samples)) or use a decent text editor with Markdown support (e.g. the free [Visual Studio Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)).

## OGS Documentation

For more documentation about OGS in general, see the main [OGS Documentation site](https://haller-erne.github.io/ogs/).

## Git and github usage notes

The current version of the sample projects is available at [https://github.com/haller-erne/ogs-samples](https://github.com/haller-erne/ogs-samples). You can browse the site and look
at individual files, download a zip archive (use the green `<Code>` button on the top right)
or use a [git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads) of your choice to clone the sample
repository.

The OGS sample repo currently only uses the `main` branch of the repository.

Please see the [git setup notes](./git-setup-notes.md) form more details and hints on using
[git](https://git-scm.com/) with OGS projects and the sample projects.
